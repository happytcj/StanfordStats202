## Problem 1

Chapter 4, Exercise 4 (p. 168).

### a) 
For the cases where 0.5 < X < 0.95, the average will be 10%. Otherwise, we form an integral as such: 

$$\int_{0}^{0.05} 100x + 5 dx$$
Which equals 0.375, multiplied by 2 for two intervals: when x < 0.05 and when x > 0.95
Thus on average our prediction is (0.1 * 0.9 + 0.00375 * 2) * 100 = 9.75%

### b) 
0.0975^2 * 100 = 0.95%

### c) 
0.0975^100 * 100 = (7.95 e-100)%

### d)
Our results show that as dimensionality increases, the number of datapoints that are close in all dimensions to the response variable decreases exponentially. 

### e)
The length will be 0.1^(1/p)
e.g. for p=1, l = 0.1^(1) = 0.1
for p=100, l = 0.1^(1/100)

Problem 2

Chapter 4, Exercise 6 (p. 170).

$$
\frac{e^{B_0+B1X_1+...+B_pX_p}}{1+e^{B_0+B_1X_1+...+B_pX_p}}\\
\frac{e^{-6+0.05*40+3.5}}{}
$$
